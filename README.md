# ir-tools

A set of CLI tools that deal with different aspects of Information
Retrieval. Most of them are done as a part of IR course at university.

# Note

Unfortunately, there are a lot of repetition and mutable state in code. Right
now I don't have enough time to do things properly( - **maybe** some of the
(design) flaws would be fixed in a (distant) future.
